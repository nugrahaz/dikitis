<h1 style="text-align:center;">Required Permissions</h1>
<hr>
<p>To provide a better experience, this app uses connection to get all the information shown in this app, collect usage data for providing and
    improving the services, and does not sell any user's information to any third party. These are the permissions the app only uses to show
    meaningful information to the user.
</p>

<p>We want to make sure that you fully understand the permission we need to make Dikitis app function how you want. It's vital that you are clear on
    how we use your data. You can choose to provide a few optional permission (such as notification, storage, and camera) depending on the features
    you intend to use.
</p>


<h2>Compulsory Permissions</h2>

<p>These permissions are required for the application's most of the features and functions. Not
    granting them will break some of the features albeit the application will continue to work.<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</li>
    <p>Used to read image files to add a photo profile from storage.</p>

    <li>CAMERA
    </li>

    <p>Used to take a picture to add a photo profile via the camera</p>


    <li>NOTIFICATION
    </li>

    <p>Used to post notifications regarding disease diagnosis results.<br>
    </p>

</ul>


<h2>Automatic Permissions</h2>

<p>These permissions are granted automatically by the system.<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>INTERNET</li>
    <p>Allows applications to use the network or internet.
    </p>

    <li>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</li>
    <p>Used to check if network is available and is connected.
    </p>

    <li>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</li>
    <p>Used to read image files from storages to add a photo profile from storage.
        Due restricted starting in Android 13 (Tiramisu), this permission has no effect, apps need permission READ_MEDIA_IMAGES.
    </p>
</ul>
